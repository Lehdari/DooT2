- 14.1. sessions were a big success
  - LSTM v0.0.1 implemented
  - Autoencoder v130.0 "mega" implemented
  - We have started to do ML instead of ML tools and ML tunks
  - Thus, Initial goal has been reached
- LSTM dev
  - while not universe ended:
    - train
    - get loss data
    - if good: good
    - if not: improve
  - plotting loss with internal or external library
- Encoder
  - Lookin' good
  - Double EDEC didn't give good results yet
