# DooT2 Meeting 3.1.2023

## Previously happened

- Created DooT2 repo
- Created random walking skeleton wip proto mvp
- Use libtorch (a c++ pytorch front)
- Use GViZDoom as a submodule
- Create a surprisingly good mvp of autoencoder 4x4x128 = 2048
-> reached the first goal of being able to dev ML algos

## Next up

- Stretch goal:
  - Find exits in random generated minimalistic maps that the agent has not ever seen
  - Throw hud to hell for this SG
- Interesting things:
  - Use LSTM
  - With this compression ratio we can fit 16 of ~4min input sequences into 1Gb of memory

- Absolutely necessary:
  - A way to generate good maps easily [x]
  - A way to generate good training sequences in these maps
    - Random walker that finds exits and makes useful sequences rich in information

  - Reward functions
    - Finding exit gives a huge reward obviously
    - Reward for finding a place you have never visited before?
    - Negative reward for not doing anything useful
    - Use heatmap
  - A way for the agent to represent confidence
    - If it visits a completely unknown area it must tell it's not confident
    - Use normal distribution parameters for example
    - Must be possible to calculate loss
  - Save and load trained models
    - Autoencoder
    - Split into encoder and decoder
  - Actionconverter
    - transform discrete action <-> continuous action
  - Sequence storage
    - Save state, action, reward for each step
    - Rewards and actions missing
