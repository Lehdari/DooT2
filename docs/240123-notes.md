# 24.1.2023 Meeting

## What was done

- CMake options
- First version of edec
- GViZDoom: remove music altogether

## What's gonna be done

- Some kind of action model
  - Actor-Critic or A3C or something else
- Boring but useful utils
  - Logging: tensorboard etc
  - CLI
    - batch size
    - scenario
    - headless
    - train / validate
    - etc


# Mile high level
- What is the true nature of this problem?
- How do humans play (FPS) games?
- Hierarchical intermediate goals and subgoals
- Intrinsic motivation and reward
- Exploration
- Interacting with the environment
- How do humans learn?
- Change goals dynamically
- Work on many level of goals in parallel
  - Immediate: low-level navigation, shooting, "living"
  - Medium: Exploring the current room / sector
  - Long: Find the red key, open the red door, find the exit, get to the exit
- JEPA has some good ideas but is hella handwavy
- Transformers are a promising tool

# Ideas for r&d
- State sequence -> actions
- Possibly interesting models
  - Dynamics = state transitions, how the world works
    - o, a -> o'
    - s, a -> s'
    - But in Doom one state or observation does not hold enough information to cover e.g. dynamics
      - Solution: use vector of observations and action to predict a new observation
        - Example: function that takes the last 10 observations (and actions) as input, and an additional action
          - Output: new observation
      - Solution2: encode some info such as player velocity in the hidden state ("observation")
  - Reward = which states are good to be in
  - Hidden = internal representation, like latent space
- MCTS saatana (MCTSS)

# Terminology

- Observation = frame, one sample of the world
- State = more information of the world
  - Perfect state = can fully reconstruct the world at one time instance from this
  - Observation is a projection of this, a "model" or "approximation"
- Hidden state 
  - Eljas: internal representation of a state or observation used by a learning agent such as NN
    - f(x) where x = observation
    - f can be an encoder for example
    - has essentially the same information as observation
  - Lehdari: an abstraction of the world
